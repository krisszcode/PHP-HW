# PHP Homework Project

### Installation

```sh
cd PHP-HW
php -S localhost:8888
```

### Usage

On the localhost:8888 URL you can access almost all of the excercises, but the last is written in SQL, it can be found in the seventh folder. 

### Challenges

In retrospect, which exercises were more difficult than the others were the first and last tasks.
- For the first, there was a regular expression that is hard to understand.
- For the last, there was a little bit hard SQL query, that I solved wrong for the first try.
